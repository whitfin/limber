//! A simple (but quick) tool for backing up Elasticsearch documents.
//!
//! It's designed for efficient import/export of Elasticsearch indices,
//! rather than complex use cases. If you want anything more than simple
//! backup/restore, you probably want to look somewhere else (or extend
//! this tool as necessary).
//!
//! Limber is only built as a command line tool, as it's simply a small
//! CLI binding around the fairly low-level Elasticsearch library APIs.
